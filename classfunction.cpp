/**
 * a class was defined as “a collection of data and the actions that can modify the data.”
 * using external functions to modify objects is not a good practice.
 * class functions, also known as class or instance methods, that serve to modify the 
 * data within objects. 
 * Think of a class function as a function that is attached to an object. 
 * The class function is the most common type of function when creating classes.
 * Notice how class functions are declared inside of the class. These functions
 * are called class functions because they have access to the class variables
 * (the attributes declared in the constructor). Class functions are invoked
 * using dot-notation.
