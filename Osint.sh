Your score for My OSINT Training Pretest Quiz is:
6/6points
Thanks for submitting the quiz. You might be interested in how we got the answers. Read below.

The Spandex Nation booking phone number appears on the top left of their website https://www.spandexnation.com/.


The lead singer's email can be found by first, finding the name of the lead singer of Spandex Nation, Peter Monroy. Then, Google that in quotes with the word "email" like this: "Peter Monroy" email (https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Peter+Monroy%22+email).


To find out historic domain ownership, look at the historic WHOIS data at https://www.whoxy.com/spandexnation.com. Remember to scroll to the bottom to see the 2016 entry!


To see IP address and company pairings, we need to examine the DNS (Domain Name System) entries for the spandexnation.com domain. Use a site like https://dnsdumpster.com/.


To find the podcast username, browse to the "podcast" menu item at the top of their web page. Then, click the "Watch on YouTube" link on any of the videos. Next, Click on the "user" SPANDEX NATION unMASKED" and the username should appear in the URL.


You can look up the business information about companies by finding the state business search page. After a quick Google, we found Nevada's is https://esos.nv.gov/EntitySearch/OnlineEntitySearch. Search it for Ronrock Publishing Inc. to find the entity number.

Of course, you might have found other methods of finding these answers and that is the amazing part of OSINT. There is generally no "right" way to do it.
