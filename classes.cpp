/***
 * In the text above, the words “class” and “object” are used in an almost
 * interchangeable manner. There are many similarities between classes and
 * objects, but there is also an important difference. Working with objects has
 * a lot of specialized vocabulary
 * Classes - Classes are a collection of data and the actions that can modify the data. 
 * Objects - Objects are constructed according to the blueprint that is the class.
 * Instance - Another way that programmers talk about objects is to say that
 * an object is an instance of a particular class. For example, s is an instance
 * of the string class.
 * Instantiation - Instantiation is the process where an object is created
 * according to a blueprint of the class. The phrase “define a variable” means
 * to create a variable. The variable is given a name and a value. Once it has
 * been defined, you can use the variable. With objects, you use the phrase
 * “instantiate an object”. That means to create an object, give it a name, store
 * any data, and define the actions the object can perform.
